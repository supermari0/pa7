El Alquimista cogió un libro que alguien de la caravana había traído. El volumen
no tenía tapas, pero consiguió identificar a su autor: Oscar Wilde. Mientras
hojeaba sus páginas encontró una historia sobre Narciso.

El Alquimista conocía la leyenda de Narciso, un hermoso joven que todos los días
iba a contemplar su propia belleza en un lago. Estaba tan fascinado consigo
mismo que un día se cayó dentro del lago y se murió ahogado. En el lugar donde
cayó nació una flor, a la que llamaron narciso.

Pero no era así como Oscar Wilde acababa la historia. Él decía que, cuando
Narciso murió, llegaron las Oréades - diosas del bosque - y vieron el lago
transformado, de un lago de agua dulce que era, en un cántaro de lágrimas
saladas.

-¿Por qué lloras?- le preguntaron las Oréades.
-Lloro por Narciso- repuso el lago.
-¡Ah, no nos asombra que llores por Narciso!- prosiguieron ellas-. Al fin
y al cabo, a pesar de que nosotras siempre corríamos tras él por el bosque, tú
eras el único que tenía la oportunidad de contemplar de cerca su belleza.

- For each rule you create, a description of what it was supposed to do, what
- differences between Language F and English it was supposed to fix. Make sure
- you give a good example of the use of the rules in your running of your code.

["NN", "RB", "VBD"]  -> ["NN", "VBD", "RB"] 
Sentence to fix: "The volume no had lids" 
Correct sentence: "The volume had no lids"
Meaning of rule: This rule makes sure that the we move adverbs after the verbs that they modify. In the example above, the original sentence is "El volumen
no tenía tapas," where "no" comes before "tenia." In english, however, "no had"
is incorrect and "had no" (or perhaps more generally "had not") is the correct wording.
["VBD", "DT", "NNS"] -> ["DT", "NNS", "VBD"]  # Subject before verb
Sentence to fix: "asked the goddesses"
Correct sentence: "the goddesses asked"
Meaning of rule: Although both sentences qualify as correct English, we
generally want to subject to come before the verb. This rule attempts to 
capture this grammatical model by moving the determiner (in this case "the") 
to the front of the sentence and reordering the subject and verb.

["VBN", "DT", "NN"]  -> ["DT","NN", "VBN"]    # Subject before verb 
Sentence to fix: "born a flower"
Correct sentence: "a flower born"
Meaning of rule: This is another rule that is supposed to reorder subjects and 
verbs in our sentences. A direct translation of the Spanish text gives us 
"born a flower," which is not as fluent as "a flower born" or perhaps even "a 
flower was born". We make this reordering by putting the noun in front of the 
verb when we see a determiner between them. 

# Prep. after possesive # of close his
beauty -> his beauty of close     
["IN", "JJ", "PRP\$", "NN"] -> ["PRP\$", "NN", "IN", "JJ"]
Sentence to fix: "of close his beauty"
Correct sentence: "his beauty of close"
Meaning of rule: We noticed that our translation put prepositions in front of 
possessives in several places. Thus, the Spanish sentence "contemplar de cerca 
su belleza" became "contemplate of close his beauty." A more natural 
translation would move "of close", the preposition, to the end of the sentence 
to get "his beauty of close."

# Prep before noun # water sweet -> water salt
["NN", "JJ"] -> ["JJ", "NN"]
Sentence to fix: "water sweet"
Correct sentence: "sweet water"
Meaning of rule: With this rule, we wanted to account for the difference 
between Spanish and English noun/adjective pairs. Spanish puts the noun before 
the adjective, while English reverses the order. We wrote this rule to obtain 
a correct order in our translation, which captured the "water sweet"/"sweet 
water" case above. Note that the same pattern occurs in other sentences, most 
notably in "tears salt" which should have been "salt(y) tears." The POS 
tagger, however, classified both words as nouns in that particular sentence, 
so there was no easy way for us to use reordering to correct the sentence.

["VBN", "PRP"] -> ["PRP", "VBN"]
Sentence to fix: "continued they"
Correct sentence: "they continued"
Meaning of rule: This is anoter case where the rules for word order around 
verbs are different in Spanish. "prosiguieron ellas" is literally translated 
to "continued they," but in English, the personal pronoun should come before 
the verb.

["DT", "PRP", "VB*"] -> ["PRP", "VB*", "DT"]
Sentence to fix: ""
Correct sentence: ""
Meaning of rule:

- remaining errors.

Although we have a decent translation of the beginning of The Alchemist, there 
are still several issues we could fix. For example, the subject is often 
implicit, which confuses our translation mechanism. "While browsing their 
pages found a history" should clearly have a "he" between "pages" and "found." 
We might be able fix this problem if we can build a more intelligent system to 
detect who or what is the subject of a given sentence. For instance, we could 
detect that the subject in the previous sentence is the alchemist and encode 
that at least a "he" or "she" would lead to a better translation than "they" 
or nothing. The sentence also provides a good example of why such a detection 
might be difficult. It is already somewhat ambiguous whether the sentence is 
referring to the book or the alchemist, and correctly interpreting this 
ambiguity is tricky. In fact, even Google Translate has problems correctly 
identifying the subject.

The Alchemist picked up a book that someone in the caravan had brought. the
volume had no covers, but managed to identify the author: Oscar Wilde. while
leafed through its pages he found a story about Narcissus.

The Alchemist knew the legend of Narcissus, a beautiful youth all days would
contemplate his own beauty in a lake. I was so fascinated himself that one day
he fell into the lake and drowned. in the where was born a flower fell, which
they called narcissus.

But that was not how the story ended Oscar Wilde. He said that when Narcissus
died, arrived Oreads - goddesses of the forest - and saw the lake transformed, a
freshwater lake that was in a jar of tears salty.

- Why are you crying? - Asked the Oreads. -I weep for Narcissus replied the
lake. - Oh, no wonder you weep for Narcissus! - Continued them. Ultimately After
all, even though we always ran after him through the woods, you were the only
one who had the opportunity to look closely at their beauty.
