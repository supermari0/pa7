El Alquimista cogió un libro que alguien de la caravana había traído. El volumen
no tenía tapas, pero consiguió identificar a su autor: Oscar Wilde. Mientras
hojeaba sus páginas encontró una historia sobre Narciso.

El Alquimista conocía la leyenda de Narciso, un hermoso joven que todos los días
iba a contemplar su propia belleza en un lago. Estaba tan fascinado consigo
mismo que un día se cayó dentro del lago y se murió ahogado. En el lugar donde
cayó nació una flor, a la que llamaron narciso.

Pero no era así como Oscar Wilde acababa la historia. Él decía que, cuando
Narciso murió, llegaron las Oréades - diosas del bosque - y vieron el lago
transformado, de un lago de agua dulce que era, en un cántaro de lágrimas
saladas.

-¿Por qué lloras?- le preguntaron las Oréades.
-Lloro por Narciso- repuso el lago.
-¡Ah, no nos asombra que llores por Narciso!- prosiguieron ellas-. Al fin
y al cabo, a pesar de que nosotras siempre corríamos tras él por el bosque, tú
eras el único que tenía la oportunidad de contemplar de cerca su belleza.

The Alchemist picked up a book that someone in the caravan had brought. the
volume had no covers, but managed to identify the author: Oscar Wilde. while
leafed through its pages he found a story about Narcissus.

The Alchemist knew the legend of Narcissus, a beautiful youth all days would
contemplate his own beauty in a lake. I was so fascinated himself that one day
he fell into the lake and drowned. in the where was born a flower fell, which
they called narcissus.

But that was not how the story ended Oscar Wilde. He said that when Narcissus
died, arrived Oreads - goddesses of the forest - and saw the lake transformed, a
freshwater lake that was in a jar of tears salty.

- Why are you crying? - Asked the Oreads. -I weep for Narcissus replied the
lake. - Oh, no wonder you weep for Narcissus! - Continued them. Ultimately After
all, even though we always ran after him through the woods, you were the only
one who had the opportunity to look closely at their beauty.
